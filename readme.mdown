###Installation:
####Software that you need to have installed to use the ardustat:
#####Mac OS X:
All software is contained in the app.
#####Linux:
- Arduino Drivers: You shouldn't need to install Arduino drivers on Linux. However, if you get an error message like "No arduinos found" even when your Ardustat is plugged in, it may indicate driver issues. In that case, see the guide [here] (http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Learning/Linux).
- [Python 2] (http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/)
- [Node.JS] (http://nodejs.org)
- [MongoDB] (http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) (See Quickstart guide for installation [here] (http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Quickstart))
- [AVRDUDE] (http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/)

#####Windows: 
- Arduino Drivers: To install the Arduino drivers on Windows, see [Getting Started Guide for Arduino] (http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows).
- [Python 2] (http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/)
- [Node.JS] (http://nodejs.org)
- [MongoDB] (http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) -- See Quickstart guide for installation [here] (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/) and make sure to follow the instructions for installing MongoDB as a Windows service
- [WinAVR] (http://winavr.sourceforge.net/download.html)
- [Visual C++ 2010] (http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express)

Note: This software is not tested with Internet Explorer or older versions of Firefox, Safari, Chrome, etc. To avoid unpredictable results, please use a modern browser.
<br>
Note: If you use an FTDI-based Arduino (NG, Diecimila, or Duemilanove), you will need to download the Arduino software [here] (http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and manually upload the firmware file located in the Firmware/firmware_12s folder.

###Instructions for first run:
1. Depending on your operating system:
<br> Mac OS X: Double click on the "Ardustat" application
<br> Linux: Execute the bash script startArdustat.sh
<br> Windows: Go to the Software folder, execute installLibs.bat, execute updatePATH.bat, and execute: node expressserver.js COM4 (replace COM4 with your arduino's actual COM port, which you can check by going to Start/Devices and Printers)
2. In a browser, go to http://localhost:8888/debug
	(stuff should be happening)
3. Upload the firmware by clicking the button marked "Upload Firmware"
4. Give your ardustat an id: in the "Set ID" box type an ID number between 0 and 240, and hit send (you only have to do this once as well, the id will persist in EEPROM)
5. We now need to calibrate the ardustat.  Put a quality resistor of known value between the working and counter clips, and then attach the reference clip to the counter clip
6. Under calibration resistor value, enter the value of your resistor in ohms, and hit send. You should see the graph changing, the yellow line should slope downwards and then reset 3 times. 
7. Your ardustat is now calibrated.  You won't have to do this again (unless you delete the calibration file or feel that the values were inaccurate). 
8. Go to http://localhost:8888/. You should now see the Potential and Current trace. Play with the the potentiostat and galvanostat settings.

From here on out, all you need to do is:
<br> Mac OS X: Double click on the "Ardustat" application
<br> Linux: Execute the bash script startArdustat.sh
<br> Windows: go to the Software folder and execute: node expressserver.js COM4 (replace COM4 with your arduino's actual COM port, which you can check by going to Start/Devices and Printers)
Then go to http://localhost:8888/

###Instructions for regular use:
- For basic manual control, go to localhost:8888/.
- For cycling, go to localhost:8888/cycler.
- For cyclic voltometry, go to localhost:8888/cv.
- To recalibrate the Ardustat or give it a new ID, go to localhost:8888/debug.
- To view the MongoDB logs, go to localhost:8888/getlogs.
